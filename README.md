# Protect
Protect is a simple mobile game made with Unity.

*The name of this project is not very creative and will probably be changed in further development.*

## Game
You have to "Protect" the wabbly object on the bottom of the screen. To do so, tap or click on the circular obstacles falling from the top. Then they'll explode and the ground won't be hurt by them.

The main goal of the game is to bump up your highscore as much as you can.

## Work in progress
The work on this project is in progress. Here are some outlooks on coming features:

**Items** will give you some help like healing you.

With **Achievements** you will be able to use some specual features to get more points and beat your highscore.

Some of these Features could be: 
* getting double points,
* decreasing the damage of obstacles
* or increasing the default health.
